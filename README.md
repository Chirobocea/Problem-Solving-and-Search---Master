# Problem Solving and Search - Master of Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to the repository for the **Problem Solving and Search** course, completed as part of the **Masterâ€™s program in Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Bucharest**.

This repository contains an **individual project** focused on implementing and analyzing classical search algorithms in AI.

## Project Overview
The project implements key search strategies including **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **A***, and **Hill Climbing**. The Jupyter Notebook demonstrates their application to problem-solving scenarios, compares their performance, and provides insights into their strengths and limitations.

For a detailed walkthrough of the algorithms, usage examples, and results, please open the included **Jupyter Notebook**.
